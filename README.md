# PHP-based-media-player-with-subtitle-pairing
A browser-based media player that pairs video/audio files with subtitles (.srt). Features include interactive subtitle playback, customizable font sizes, day/night mode, and responsive design. Hover over subtitles to play specific segments.

I usually use https://github.com/SubtitleEdit, https://aegisub.org/ and https://www.audacityteam.org/ to create and play around with subtitles. 

**Note:** Avoid loading large media files in your browser with this PHP script, as it may lead to audio cut-offs.
